# SoC_Microblaze
Microblaze code and other code for Vivado and Vitis homework.

This code is for Dr. Schubert's System on Chip class for the Fall 2023.
It is covering the Microblazer architecture provided by Dr. Chu in the System Verilog book.

Initial code is the code completed in the class and uploaded onto GitHub.
Further updates will come when code progresses with the class.

Final project will be using both a PS2 interface with a keyboard and the VGA interface to implement
a calculator that can be used by the keyboard.
