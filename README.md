# SoC_Microblaze
Microblaze code and other code for Vivado and Vitis homework.

This code is for Dr. Schubert's System on Chip class for the Fall 2023.
It is covering the Microblaze mcs architecture provided by Dr. Chu in the System Verilog book.

Initial code is the code completed in the class and uploaded onto GitHub.
Further updates will come when code progresses with the class.

Final project will be using both a PS2 interface with a keyboard and the VGA interface to implement
a simple maze game.

Functionality:
The game starts after a key is pressed on the keyboard.
The player then has unlimited time to find the exit to the maze.
They cannot cross the walls of the maze and the only way to win is to find the one exit.
After a few seconds, the game will repeat.

Here is the link to the video of my demonstration:

EDIT: 11/24/2023
Game is completed, works as intended.
